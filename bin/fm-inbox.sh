# fm-inbox.sh - the captain's out-of-band capture surface.
#
# Solves three DIFFERENT problems with three different mechanisms, because they
# are not the same problem:
#
#   note    Queue an idea for firstmate while firstmate is mid-turn and cannot
#           answer. Writes a durable record and appends ONE `check` wake, so the
#           note survives a crash and is presented at firstmate's next drain.
#           This is the only subcommand that touches firstmate's wake queue.
#   say     Same as `note`, but the body comes from spoken audio on stdin.
#           Speech is an INPUT METHOD here, not an architecture: it transcribes
#           and then takes exactly the `note` path.
#   status  Answer "what is happening" from durable records ONLY. Reads no
#           network and appends NO wake, so it never interrupts work and is safe
#           to run in a loop.
#   ask     Answer a side question with a one-shot model call that never touches
#           firstmate, the backlog, or the wake queue. A side question is not
#           fleet work and must not become fleet work.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-inbox.sh note [--source <value>] <text>...
#                                       | fm-inbox.sh note -   (body from stdin)
#   fm-inbox.sh say  [<file.wav>]       (default: audio on stdin)
#   fm-inbox.sh status
#   fm-inbox.sh ask  <question>...
#   fm-inbox.sh list
#   fm-inbox.sh drain [--ack <id>... | --ack-notifications <id>...]
#
# Every record names its writer in a `source` field: `text` (the default) is the
# captain writing out of band, `voice` is the captain's own dictation through
# `say`, and `relay` is a notification one of firstmate's own integrations queued.
# The source decides WHEN the record is archived, never whether it is presented;
# docs/watcher-continuity.md owns that contract. A source value is limited to
# [A-Za-z0-9._-] so it can never break the record's header, and no record ever
# carries a credential.
#
# Configuration. A region, a model id and an AWS profile name somebody's account
# and somebody's choices, so this file carries no default for any of them. Each is
# read from the home's gitignored config/ directory, or from the matching
# environment variable, and the model-backed subcommands refuse with the path to
# write rather than reaching for a value that belongs to another home. That
# configuration is also the opt-in: `say` and `ask` are off until it exists.
#
#   config/inbox-region     FM_INBOX_REGION     AWS region.            required
#   config/inbox-stt-model  FM_INBOX_STT_MODEL  speech-to-text model.  required by say
#   config/inbox-ask-model  FM_INBOX_ASK_MODEL  side-question model.   required by ask
#   config/inbox-profile    FM_INBOX_PROFILE    AWS profile.           optional
#
# An absent profile means the call uses whatever credentials are already in the
# environment, which is also what FM_INBOX_PROFILE= (empty) forces.
#
# `note`, `status`, `list` and `drain` need NO configuration at all, because they
# make no model call. The voice handover depends on `note`, so it keeps working in
# a home that has configured nothing.
#
# Environment:
#   FM_HOME              operational home whose state/ and data/ are used.
#   FM_MACHINE_FILE      machine file whose "Long-lived maintenance lanes" line
#                        names this endpoint's lanes (default ~/AGENTS.md).
#   FM_MACHINE_KEY_FILE  the file naming this machine's fleet key, matched against
#                        the joined lane map's endpoints (default ~/.pi/agent/data/origmd-machine).
#   FM_LANES_JSON        the fleet's joined "repository to endpoint and lane" map
#                        (default ~/code/origmd/ref/lanes.json).
#   FM_WIRE_CONFIG       wire's own config, read for the endpoint key a lane's
#                        registered name belongs to (default ~/.config/wire/config.json).
#
# PRIVACY: `say` sends your audio and `ask` sends your question to Bedrock.
# `note`, `status`, `list` and `drain` make no network call at all.
#
# `note` is also the queueing half of the spoken interface: when the voice agent
# in bin/fm-voice-relay.py hands real work over to firstmate, it runs this
# subcommand rather than carrying a second queue of its own. Keep the `note`
# contract stable for that caller. `status` is the HUMAN view of the records;
# bin/fm_voice_records.py owns the scope-controlled machine view the voice agent
# reads, because the voice agent must be able to answer without record free text
# ever reaching a model.

# ------------------------------------------------------------- lane dispatch
#
# A merge wake for a repository this endpoint maintains with a long-lived
# maintenance lane belongs in that lane's own session: the lane is the reader the
# wake exists for, and archiving the note as handled leaves it with nothing.
# Which lane serves a repository is read first from the fleet's joined map,
# <origmd clone>/ref/lanes.json, which scripts/owners.mjs writes from the machine
# file's lane list and each lane's own checkout and which the fleet's rules name
# as where a wake finds its endpoint and lane; only entries naming this machine
# count, because a repository another machine maintains is that machine's own
# dispatch. When that map is absent or names nothing for the repository, the same
# question is answered from this endpoint's machine file (the injected copy of
# admin/origmd's inject/machines/<key>.md, whose "Long-lived maintenance lanes"
# line carries each lane's name and directory) plus the repository each lane's own
# directory checks out, so a lane checking out a different repository takes the
# ordinary archive path either way. wire is addressed by the lane name, and the
# endpoint key `--to` needs is read back from wire's own config - the row
# registering that name is this endpoint's row - so the machine key/endpoint
# pairing is never restated here.
#
# Refusal is fail-closed: a lane that serves the repository but cannot be reached
# - no key for its registered name, no wire on the machine, or a refused send -
# leaves the note and its wake row where they are, retryable, instead of
# reporting a delivery that did not happen. A repository with no lane takes the
# pre-existing archive path.
